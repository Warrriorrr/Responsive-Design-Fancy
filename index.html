      <h2>Responsive website design</h2>
      <p>The whole point of this website is to show the use of media queries.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Ahhhh yes, media queries. I hate em. It took me a few days to get ahole of them all by myself. One of the biggest things I never understood is if there were a certain set of sizes that everyone uses. Like 480, 767, 979, and 1200. Those are all the sizes that this website started out using, no other ones. I've searched google and used frameworks like <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (Cool fact: This site uses skeleton.) but I could never really click with the many features with Bootstrap. The cold hard facts are that you need THESE media queries if you want to get started with responsive design:</p>
    <p> - None</p>
    <p>There is a bar below, that will change color based on the kind of device you are using, i'll go through how I made it right after. It took some time to make so hopefully it is useful in some way for you, just as it was for me while making it. Use the code and practice!</p>
    <div id="bar">
